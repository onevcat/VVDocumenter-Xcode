# VVDocumenter-Xcode [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode.png)](https://travis-ci.org/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode)

## What is this?

Writing document is so important for developing, but it is really painful with Xcode. Think about how much time you are wasting in pressing '*' or '/', and typing the parameters again and again. Now, you can find the method (or any code) you want to document to, and type in `///`, the document will be generated for you and all params and return will be extracted into a Javadoc style, which is compatible with both [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) and [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). You can just fill the inline placeholders to finish your document。

Here is an image which can show what it exactly does.

## How to use it?

Build the `VVDocumenter-Xcode` target in the Xcode project and the plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. Relaunch Xcode and type in `///` above any code you want to write a document to.

If you want to use other text beside of `///` to trigger the document insertion, you can find a setting panel by clicking `VVDocument` in the Window menu of Xcode. You can also set using spaces instead of tab in the panel. Two other options are to prefix each line with star (on by default) and automatically add `@since` in every document.

## Xcode version?

This plug-in is developed and tested in Mac OSX 10.8.5 Xcode 4.6.3. It should work in all versions of Xcode 4. If you want to use it in Xcode 5 (DP3 or above), you have to make a liittle change in the plist. This is all what I can say now under the NDA.

The default deployment target is 10.8. If you want to use it in a earlier OS version, you should change OS X Deployment Target (in project info setting) to your system version.

## Limitations

The plugin is using simulation of keyboard event to insert the doc comments for you. So it is depending the keyboard shortcut of Xcode. These two kinds of operation are being used:

* Delete to Beginning of the Line (⌘⌫)
* Paste (⌘V)

If you have modified these two shortcuts in your Xcode, the newset version of the plugin would not work correctly. Instead, you can use a earlier version such as [this one(commit 03c4169ff7)](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode/tree/03c4169ff79b618b9fd3db93dd96652a522ad3e0). Be causion you may suffer an [undo and redo issue ](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode/issues/3).

And there are a set of code type I hope to support, but now I just finished some of them.

* Objc Method (Done)
* C Function (Done)
* Macro (Done)
* Property (Done)
* Variable (Done)
* Enum (To do)
* Struct (To do)
* Union (To do)

Now the docs for to-do types will be generated only with a basic description (which is the same as Property and Variable).
